    <p>
        Somebody once told me that I was built like a monkey and that is not true. Monkeys don't have the mental capacity that I have. Not only that, I don't eat bananas like monkeys do. I would appreciate if whoever started this rumor would come forward and get slapped. Anyway Ive been making money like this monkey and there is no-one to stop me except myself.
